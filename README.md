# Diabetes_Binary_Predictions
This project uses various health indicators/choices to predict if someone will develop diabetes 

Models used: decision tree, random forest, naive bayes(gaussian), knn, logistic regression, xgboost

This study is important because the ability to predict who will develop diabetes will heavily impact the healthcare industry. Given that everyone has experienced or will encounter health issues at some point, health professionals can proactively try to reduce this possibility by educating the public. By creating a global understanding from healthcare professionals to the general public, we have the potential to reverse the declining life expectancy and quality of life ratings. Therefore, developing a model that accurately predicts diabetes goes beyond its impact on the health industry. It becomes a transformative force for the well-being of all individuals.
